# cinema-ticketing-system - PUSL2024 Course Work

A modern web-based platform for cinema ticket booking, developed using Java, JSP, and Servlets, and hosted on the Apache Tomcat server. This system provides a seamless experience for customers to browse movies, select seats, and complete reservations with ease. Key features include:

Online Seat Reservation: Allows customers to view available seats and reserve them instantly.
Secure Online Payment: Integrates payment processing for easy and secure ticket purchases.
Collision-Free Bookings: Ensures real-time updates to prevent double-booking.
Customer Feedback Visualization: Provides analytics for customer feedback to aid in managerial decisions.
Notification System: Sends SMS or email notifications for ticket confirmations and cancellations.

This project demonstrates a full-stack Java solution, with JSP and Servlets managing backend logic, MySQL handling database operations, and Apache Tomcat serving as the web server. The aim is to bring a modernized, efficient ticketing experience to cinema-goers and streamline theater management.
